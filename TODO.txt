QKV/FFN micro‑FSMs (later, if you need area/timing)

    Q1. Time‑multiplex matrixVectorMult for Q/K/V and W_O
        One MAC lane accumulates over HeadDimension/ModelDim with a “done” pulse.
        Turn qkvDoneSig/ffnDoneSig from True into the real pulses.


Hazard/overlap (once TDP is in place)

    H1. Overlap reads and writes
        While port A streams reads for t = 0..pos, port B writes K,V for row pos.
        Keep the t==pos bypass in streamHeadAttention to avoid read‑during‑write issues.



Numeric realism

    Using Float throughout with sin/cos/exp/softmax will not synthesize efficiently. For a hardware decoder you’ll want:
        Fixed‑point or bfloat16 datapath.
        RoPE via LUT or CORDIC.
        Softmax via two‑pass streaming log‑sum‑exp or a stable single‑pass approximation.
        Dot products accumulated sequentially to keep area reasonable.
    Clash supports Float, but resource usage will be enormous unless you scale model sizes way down.



What to change at a high level

A workable 5‑stage per‑layer micro‑architecture (each stage can itself iterate):

    S1: Pre‑norm and Q/K/V
        x̂ = RMSNorm_att(x)
        Q/K/V matmuls for the heads needed at this layer (MQA: compute K,V once per KV head group)
        Apply RoPE to Q and K at pos
        Write K,V[pos] to KV RAM

    S2: Score pass (sequential)
        For each head: stream K[t] for t=0..pos; accumulate s[t] = dot(Q, K[t]) * inv_sqrt_d
        Track max per head for softmax stability

    S3: Softmax and value pass (sequential)
        Re‑scan t=0..pos: a[t] = exp(s[t]−max)/sum; accumulate O_head += a[t]*V[t]

    S4: Output projection + residual
        O = concat_heads(O_head) · Wo
        x ← x + O

    S5: FFN (pre‑norm + SwiGLU + projection) + residual
        ŷ = RMSNorm_ffn(x)
        h1 = SiLU(ŷ·W1); h3 = ŷ·W3; z = (h1 ⊙ h3) · W2
        x ← x + z


-------------------------------------


3. KV-cache write/read timing
Make sure the K/V computed at Cycle2 are actually the ones written in Cycle4:

    In Cycle4 you do writeSequencer isC4 pos (getK dataSig kv, getV dataSig kv).
    dataSig at Cycle4 must contain the keys/values that were computed in Cycle2 for this same layer/pos. If the pipeline register that holds IntermediateData is only updated on certain stage boundaries, it’s easy to end up writing zeros (initial state) into RAM. Quick check:
    Put an assertion or a dump around Cycle4 that prints a few K/V elements being written (for pos>0) and compare to the values you produced in Cycle2. If they’re zero at write time, you’re not latching the Cycle2 results into dataSig before Cycle4 uses them.
    Symptom of broken cache writes: generations look like shallow “bag of words,” because attention can only see the current token (you bypass t==pos correctly) but not previous timesteps (RAM returns zeros).

Actionable checklist to get to bit-for-bit parity

    Probe KV writes (Cycle4) and reads (Cycle3) as described to ensure the cache is populated with your Cycle2 K/V.
    If your checkpoint comes from the “skip RoPE tables” format, compute RoPE on-the-fly.

--------------------------------- Bug fixing

Summary of what we found and fixed

    Tokenizer mismatch: Fixed. Your Haskell tokenizer now mirrors llama2.c, so inputs/outputs use the same token IDs.
    W_O handling: Splitting W_O by per‑head column blocks and summing is mathematically equivalent to a single matmul with concat(heads). Not the root cause.
    Real issue (fixed): Attention “done” timing. You were committing/observing the attention output on a micro‑FSM done that wasn’t aligned with the per‑head engines, so the concatenated head output was all zeros at pos 0. After switching to “done when all heads are done,” layer 0, pos 0 matches the C implementation (within expected FP noise).
    RoPE: Switched to on‑the‑fly RoPE identical to C. It didn’t change the output, so RoPE was not the remaining issue.
    Current status: Layer 0, pos 0 traces agree with C. Generated text still diverges for pos > 0, which points to something that matters only after timestep 0:
        KV cache across timesteps (write in Cycle4, read in next token’s Cycle3).
        Classifier tying vs unshared Wcls in the checkpoint (stories15M usually shares, but you should still detect the header flag).
        Minor: stopping on BOS (=1) for apples‑to‑apples display with C (your Haskell driver doesn’t early-stop, which can make results look different even if early tokens match).

What to check next (when you resume)

    KV cache at pos 1:
        Trace layer 0, pos 1 (same four taps: xHat, concat, W_O@concat, x_after) and compare with C. If they diverge at pos 1, examine the K/V written at pos 0 vs the K/V read at t=0 on pos 1.
    Classifier sharing:
        Parse the header’s vocab_size sign like C does. If negative, weights are unshared and you must load/ use a separate Wcls (dim × vocab) for logits; otherwise tie to the embedding.
    Display parity:
        Optional but helpful: stop printing when next==1 (BOS) to match the C program’s termination.

How to re‑enable the Haskell trace (layer 0, pos 0)
Below are minimal snippets to put the instrumentation back in. They’re the “known good” versions that avoid <<loop>> and align the done timing with the per‑head engines.

    Add a small trace payload

    In Model.hs:

haskell
data TracePack = TracePack
{ trToken   :: Token
, trXHat8   :: C.Vec 8 Float
, trConcat8 :: C.Vec 8 Float
, trWoTimes8:: C.Vec 8 Float
, trXAfter8 :: C.Vec 8 Float
} deriving (Show, Generic, NFDataX)

2. Helper to concatenate heads

    In Helpers.hs (and export it):

haskell
concatHeads :: C.Vec NumQueryHeads (C.Vec HeadDimension a) -> C.Vec ModelDim a
concatHeads = CV.concat

3. In Model.multiCycleTransformerLayer

    Collect per‑head outputs and per‑head done flags from streamHeadAttentionAddrIO.
    Create a layer “done” pulse when all heads are done.
    Build the trace vectors and gate them with that pulse.

Key pieces (sketch; integrate into your function where you already compute heads):

haskell
-- collect per-head outputs and dones (out: Vec NumQHeads (Signal (Vec HeadDim Float)), done: Vec NumQHeads (Signal Bool))
(headsOutSigsVec, headDoneSigsVec) :: (C.Vec NumQueryHeads (C.Signal dom (C.Vec HeadDimension Float)), C.Vec NumQueryHeads (C.Signal dom Bool))
-- ... fill them as you connect each head; headDoneSigsVec gets the 'done' from each head

-- layer done = rising edge of AND across all head dones
doneAllHeadsSig :: C.Signal dom Bool
doneAllHeadsSig = fmap and (C.sequenceA headDoneSigsVec)
doneAllPrev = C.register False doneAllHeadsSig
attnDoneThisLayerSig = C.liftA2 (\n p -> n && not p) doneAllHeadsSig doneAllPrev

-- recompute xHat for trace clarity
xHatSig     = rmsNorm . idInputVec <$> dataSig <> pure (rmsAtt mha)
concatHeadSig = concatHeads <$> C.sequenceA headsOutSigsVec
woTimesSig  = attnSumSig                     -- your sum of per-head slices (W_O @ concat)
xAfterSig   = zipWith (+) . idInputVec <$> dataSig <> woTimesSig

let take8 = CV.take (C.SNat @8)
packed = C.bundle ( take8 <$> xHatSig
, take8 <$> concatHeadSig
, take8 <$> woTimesSig
, take8 <$> xAfterSig )
traceValid = pure (layerIdx == 0) C..&&. ((== 0) <$> posSig) C..&&. attnDoneThisLayerSig
rawTraceThisLayer :: C.Signal dom (Maybe (C.Vec 8 Float, C.Vec 8 Float, C.Vec 8 Float, C.Vec 8 Float))
rawTraceThisLayer = C.mux traceValid (Just <$> packed) (pure Nothing)

    Return rawTraceThisLayer from multiCycleTransformerLayer and thread it upward (combine different layers with (<|>) so only the first Just passes through). Attach the current token to produce TracePack:

haskell
tracePackSig :: C.Signal dom (Maybe TracePack)
tracePackSig =
let attach tok (Just (a,b,c,d)) = Just (TracePack tok a b c d)
attach _   Nothing          = Nothing
in attach <$> tokenSig <*> traceLayer0Sig

    Change topEntity to return (token, ready, maybe TracePack).

4. Avoid <<loop>>: finite “trace pass,” then normal generation

    In Main.generateTokensSimAutoregressive, before your knot‑tied simulation, run a finite pass to collect and print the first trace:

haskell
-- Pass 1: finite trace capture (constant token t0)
let t0 = case promptTokens of (x:) -> x; [] -> 1
traceCycles = 10000
traceInputs = replicate traceCycles (t0, temperature, seed)
traceOutputs :: [(Token, Bool, Maybe TracePack)]
traceOutputs = CS.simulate (bundledOutputs decoder) traceInputs
mTrace = case [tr | (,,Just tr) <- traceOutputs] of
(tr:) -> Just tr; [] -> Nothing
case mTrace of
Just tr -> do
putStrLn "\n[TRACE] layer 0, pos 0"
printVec :: (Show a) => [a] -> IO (); printVec = putStrLn . show
putStrLn $ "token=" ++ show (trToken tr)
printVec (CV.toList (trXHat8 tr))
printVec (CV.toList (trConcat8 tr))
printVec (CV.toList (trWoTimes8 tr))
printVec (CV.toList (trXAfter8 tr))
Nothing -> putStrLn "\n[TRACE] not observed in window."

-- Pass 2: your usual knot‑tied autoregressive simulation (unchanged)

5. Bundling

    Ensure bundledOutputs/topEntityBundled expose the triple:

haskell
bundledOutputs
:: TransformerDecoderComponent
-> CS.Signal CS.System (Token, Temperature, Seed)
-> CS.Signal C.System (Token, Bool, Maybe TracePack)

topEntityBundled
:: CS.HiddenClockResetEnable dom
=> TransformerDecoderComponent
-> C.Signal dom (Token, Temperature, Seed)
-> (C.Signal dom Token, C.Signal dom Bool, C.Signal dom (Maybe TracePack))

Remaining suspects for the “still different” text

    KV cache across timesteps: if pos 1 trace diverges from C, inspect that you write K/V for pos 0 and then read exactly those at t=0 for pos 1 (bank addressing, bypass alignment, RAM latency).
    Classifier sharing: parse the 7 Int32 config header like C; if vocab_size was negative, load a separate Wcls and use it in transformerLogits instead of tying to embeddings.
    Stop on BOS (=1) for a fair visual comparison.

If you keep these snippets handy, you can quickly re‑instrument, capture pos 1 traces from both C and Clash, and we can pinpoint any remaining mismatch in a few minutes next time.
